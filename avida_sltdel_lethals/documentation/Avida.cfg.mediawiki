The Avida configuration file (<kbd>avida.cfg</kbd>) is the main configuration file for Avida. With this file, the user can setup all of the basic conditions for a run.

<strong>avida.cfg is actually an excellent guide to itself</strong>; every option has a description of what it does and what its options are, and many of these pages will simply refer you to the file itself instead of replicating that description.  We endeavor here to give extended explanations of particularly common or confusing options, and of settings that interact with other settings.
