These settings control internal resources for organisms: how much can be collected at once, limitations on the amount that can be stored, how the internal resources are used to acquire task rewards, and the internal resource state of new organisms.  Details are available in the avida.cfg file itself.

For more information on resource uptake, see <a href="Internal-resources" title="Internal Resources: an explanation and guide to use">Internal Resources: an explanation and guide to use</a>.
