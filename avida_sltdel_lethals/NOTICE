The Avida source code in this repository has been modified to output more information when measuring fitness landscapes (FullLandscape, RandomLandscape, etc).

All edited Avida files are in /avida_sltdel_lethals/avida-core/source/main/.
Specifically, the modified files are:
cLandscape.h
cLandscape.cc

These changes cause Avida to report "slightly deleterious" mutations, which are deleterious mutations that reduce fitness by less than 5%. Additionally, it has been modified to output the average fitness of all deleterious *and* lethal mutations. This is distinct from "Average Deleterious Size", which outputs information only on the average fitness of deleterious, but not lethal, mutations.
