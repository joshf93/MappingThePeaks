The Avida source code in this repository has been modified to output more information when measuring fitness landscapes (FullLandscape, RandomLandscape, etc).

All edited Avida files are in /avida_sltdel_lethals/avida-core/source/.
Specifically, the modified files are:
main/cLandscape.h
main/cLandscape.cc
actions/PrintActions.cc


The first two changes cause Avida to report "slightly deleterious" mutations, which are deleterious mutations that reduce fitness by less than 5%. Additionally, it has been modified to output the average fitness of all deleterious *and* lethal mutations. This is distinct from "Average Deleterious Size", which outputs information only on the average fitness of deleterious, but not lethal, mutations.

The last mutation lets Avida dump lineage grids for making competition videos.
